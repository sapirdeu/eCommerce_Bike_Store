# Final project- B.Sc in Computer Science, BIU

The project consists various components:
- Introvert and extrovert chatbot (cloud- AWS)
- Chatbot research analysis for the researchers - complicated statistics analysis including heavy calculations and graphs plots
- Web application that demonstrates a bike shop (Frontend- React + Redux, Backend- NodeJS + Python, DB- mongoDB) that uses APIâ€™s of external services (Paypal, Cloudinary)
- Business rental bikes PoC (using ML + Anomaly Detection techniques)
    - Prediction models to predict number of bikes rented
